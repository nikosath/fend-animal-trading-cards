			<p>Rocky came to be with us by virtue of his strong voice. One month ago, he was wandering alone in front of our building. He was starving and crying so loud, that his complaints reached our ears on the third floor. Now he's with us, safe, loved for, and with a happy tummy. I wish him a good life!</p>
